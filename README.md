# pandas

This python script will replace those null values in Address column with a default value 'No Address'. It will generate a csv file 'updatedreport.csv'.

Steps to replicate:

```
1. Create two paths (one for output and one for reference)
2. Paste the paths to config.ini file
  a. destination_folder = output
  This is where the output csv will be saved.
  b. reference_folder = copy the 'report.csv' file in the reference path folder you've created.
3. Run the code pandaspoc.py
4. Check the output folder if the output csv is generated.
```
